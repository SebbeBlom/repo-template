# Folder Descriptions
## LICENSE
This file contains the licensing information for your project. Choose a license that suits your project, such as MIT, Apache, or GPL, and ensure you fill out the relevant details.

## Makefile
The Makefile automates the build process. Define targets such as:
- all: Build the entire project.
- clean: Remove generated files.
- test: Compile and run tests.
- install: Install the binaries or libraries.

## README.md
This file provides a detailed overview of the project, including how to build, test, and use the software. It also explains the folder structure.

## benchmark/
Use this folder for performance testing and benchmarking tools or scripts. Store any benchmarks, profiling results, or related utilities here.

## bin/
This directory is for compiled binaries and executables produced by the project. For example:
- The main application binary will be stored here after compilation.
- This folder should only contain production-ready binaries.

## coverage/
Generated code coverage reports (e.g., from gcov, lcov, or similar tools) go here. This directory is typically populated during testing and can be excluded from version control using .gitignore.

## docs/
Store all project-related documentation here. Examples include:
- usage.md: Instructions for using the software.
- installation.md: Steps to install and set up the project.
- api.md: Documentation for APIs or libraries.

## gc.sup
This is a suppression file for tools like gcov or valgrind to exclude specific warnings or files from analysis. Modify it based on your project’s requirements.

## include/
Store all header files (.h) in this directory. These files define the interfaces and declarations for the project. Examples:
- include/project.h: Main project header.
- include/utils.h: Utility function declarations.

## lib/
Place external or internal libraries used by the project here. Examples:
- .so or .a files for shared or static libraries.
- Third-party dependencies or your custom libraries.

## src/
This is the main directory for the project’s source code (.c files). Examples:
- src/main.c: Entry point of the application.
- src/utils.c: Implementation of utility functions.

## test/
This directory contains all files related to testing. Structure:
- test_main.c: The main test source file where all unit tests are defined.
- bin/: Binaries or executables created from the test code are stored here.

# Outputs
- Binaries: All compiled executables for production are placed in bin/.
- Test Binaries: Test-related executables are stored in test/bin/.
- Coverage Reports: Generated files from coverage tools are stored in coverage/.
